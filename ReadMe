This is a modification to the installkernel script provided as part of sysapps/debianutils-4.8.6 to allow the make install command to copy an EFI stub kernel to the EFI Systems Partition and to create an EFI boot command for that kernel. Existing make install functions should be unchanged. Frequent kernel updates will flood /boot, /EFI/gentoo on the ESP, and the EFI boot menu. Manual trash removal required. Download, decompress (if needed), copy to /sbin, make it executable. Quick test by running make install from /usr/src/linux for a working kernel.
